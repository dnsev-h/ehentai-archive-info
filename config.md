# config.json

The config file stores settings used to control how the program operates.
The default settings are set up for the general use case, but they can be further
adjusted depending on the needs.

## Replacement Tags

Metadata file names can also be formatted with specific tags to help disambiguate them if necessary.
Currently the only tag is ```${name}``` which corresponds to the name of the archive file or folder,
excluding the file extension.


## Cookies

By default, E-Hentai will be used rather than ExHentai.
If you want to use ExHentai, you must set up the required authentication cookies.
You can do this by creating a file called ```cookies.txt``` next to the ```config.json``` file
and saving a cookie string into the contents. The cookie string should not contain any quotes.

To find your cookie string, open a web browser which is already logged in, open the website,
and then open the browser's developer tools (shortcut key: F12). Then, navigate to the
Console tab and type/paste the following code:
```js
console.log(document.cookie)
```

This should print your cookie string to the console. For example, the cookie string may look something like this:
```
ipb_member_id=XXXXXXX; ipb_pass_hash=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX; igneous=XXXXXXXXX
```
